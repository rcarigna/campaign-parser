## 🤔 **Current Architecture Decisions**

### **Export Format Philosophy**

- **JSON**: Developer-friendly, preserves full data structure
- **CSV**: Spreadsheet-compatible, flattened entity fields  
- **Campaign Bundle**: ZIP with multiple formats + original documents

### **Dynamic Schema Architecture**

```typescript
// Schema definition format
type EntitySchema = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: number;
  fields: SchemaField[];
  icon: string;
  color: string;
  requiredFields: string[];
}

type SchemaField = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'text' | 'number' | 'enum' | 'boolean' | 'date' | 'array' | 'relationship';
  options?: {
    enumValues?: string[];
    min?: number;
    max?: number;
    relationshipType?: string;
    arrayItemType?: 'text' | 'number' | 'enum';
    placeholder?: string;
    helpText?: string;
  };
  validation?: {
    required: boolean;
    pattern?: string;
    customValidator?: string;
  };
  conditional?: {
    showWhen: string; // Field ID
    equals: any; // Value that triggers showing this field
  };
}

// Runtime schema to Zod conversion
const generateZodSchema = (schema: EntitySchema) => {
  // Dynamically build Zod validation based on schema definition
}
```

### **Entity Relationship Model**

```typescript
type EntityRelationship = {
  id: string;
  fromEntityId: string;
  toEntityId: string;
  relationshipType: 'owns' | 'located_in' | 'member_of' | 'allied_with' | 'enemy_of' | 'custom';
  description?: string;
  confidence?: number;
}
```

### **Bulk Operations UX**

- Checkbox selection model (familiar pattern)
- Floating action button for bulk operations
- Modal-based bulk edit (consistent with existing patterns)
- Clear visual feedback for selected items
