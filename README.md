## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rcarigna/campaign-parser.git
cd campaign-parser/workspace

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open browser to http://localhost:3000
```

### Usage

1. **Upload** your session notes (DOC or Markdown)
2. **Review** extracted entities in the grid view
3. **Edit** any entity details or change entity types
4. **Merge** duplicate entities using the selection tool
5. **Export** your organized vault as a ZIP file

### Git Hooks

This project uses a pre-push hook to ensure code quality before pushing to the repository. The hook automatically:

- ✅ Runs ESLint for code style checks
- ✅ Runs TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`) to catch type errors
- ❌ Prevents push if any errors are found

The hook is automatically installed when you run `npm install`. If you need to manually set it up:

```bash
# Manually install Git hooks
npm run prepare
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Modern Next.js Stack

- **Next.js 16**: App Router with React Server Components
- **React Compiler**: Automatic optimization for complex entity operations
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety across client and server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, modern UI design

### API Routes (Server-Side Business Logic)

### Coverage by Area

- **Component Tests**: UI components with user interactions using real entity data
- **Hook Tests**: Custom React hooks (useCampaignParser, useEntitySelection, useFileManager)
- **API Tests**: All endpoints (parse, export, demo, health)
- **Library Tests**: Entity extraction, template engine, validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end workflows with real campaign data
- **Hook Tests**: Custom React hooks with mock integrations
- **API Tests**: Next.js API routes with request/response validation
- **Entity Extraction Tests**: Both NLP and regex engines validated against actual D&D session content
- **Real Data Validation**: Tests use authentic campaign session (`session_summary_1.md`) with 7,220 characters of D&D content

### Test Data Quality

Our tests use **real campaign session data** instead of synthetic mocks:

- **Authentic D&D Content**: Actual session summary from "Waterdeep: Dragon Heist"
- **Entity Validation**: NPCs (Durnan, Bonnie, Yagra), Locations (Yawning Portal, Waterdeep), Items (ancestral blade)
- **Accuracy Testing**: Both NLP and regex extractors validated against real campaign entities
- **No Mock Dependencies**: Eliminated complex library mocking in favor of real data validation
