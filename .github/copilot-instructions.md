## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application for document parsing:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API and document processing
- **Functionality**: Upload documents (DOC/MD files) and display parsed JSON output

## Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety
- Use proper error handling for file uploads
- Implement clean separation between client and server code
- Focus on document parsing accuracy and user experience
- Prefer arrow functions over traditional function declarations
- Maintain 80% unit test coverage
- Prefer types over interfaces where applicable
- Prefer functional programming paradigms where applicable
- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Avoid let and var; use const wherever possible
- Avoid hard-coded values; use configuration files or environment variables
- Maintain single responsibility principle in functions and modules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write modular, testable, and reusable code
- Document code with succinct & simple comments where necessary
- Adhere to consistent code formatting and style conventions
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting
- Use Material-UI and styled-components for consistent styling in the frontend
- Use Jest and React Testing Library for testing the frontend
- Use module-aliases for cleaner import paths in both client and server code
- Use ES modules syntax (import/export) throughout the codebase
