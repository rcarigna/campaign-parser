## Project Overview

This is a full-stack web application for document parsing:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API and document processing
- **Functionality**: Upload documents (DOC/MD files) and display parsed JSON output

## Development Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety
- Use proper error handling for file uploads
- Implement clean separation between client and server code
- Focus on document parsing accuracy and user experience
- **Prefer arrow functions** over traditional function declarations
- **Prefer types over interfaces** where applicable
- **Prefer functional programming paradigms** where applicable
- **Use const** over let and var wherever possible
- **Use ES modules syntax** (import/export) throughout the codebase
- Follow KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle
- Write modular, testable, and reusable code
